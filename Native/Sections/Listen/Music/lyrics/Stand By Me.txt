This song says, no matter who you are,
No matter where you go in your life
At some point you're going to need
Somebody to stand by you.
Oh yeah! Oh my darlin' stand by me!
No matter who your are, no matter where you go in life
You gon' need somebody, to stand by you.
No matter how much money you got, or the friends you got,
You gon' need somebody, to stand by you
When the night has come, and the way is dark,
And that moon is the only light you see.
No I won't be afraid, no I-I-I won't be afraid
Just as long as the people come and stand by me.
Darlin' darlin' stand by me, ooh stand by me Oh stand
Stand stand by me C'mon stand by me stand by me
If the sky that we look upon
Well should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't she'd a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
Oh darling, darling stand by me, oh stand by me,
Oh please stand, stand by me, stand by me.
Oh darling, darling stand by me, oh stand by me,
Please stand, stand by me, stand by me.
Oh baby, baby
Oh darlin' darlin' stand la la nomie
Ooh stand la la nomie, O stand O stand stand
Stand by me c'mon stand by me, stand by me.
Stand la la nomie, oh won't you stand, la la nomie,
Oh stand la la nomie, stand by me, c'mon stand by me.
When the night has come, and the way is dark
And the moon, is the only light you see
I won't be afraid, lala nomie, I won't be afraid
Not as long, not as long as you stand by me.
